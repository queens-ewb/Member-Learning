Defined poverty:

 * < $1.25/day
 * Lack of...
    * healthcare
    * security
    * education**
    * access to clean water
    * dignity
    * lack of influence / voice / control
 * vulnerability
 * NOT necessarily a lack of happiness!


Being poor to us would mean

 * hunger
 * uncertainty
 * dependence on others
 * feelings of desperation
 * uncertainty about the future


Some of the things on the second list are things we don't think of when using the term "Poverty".
eg. uncertainty about the future -- that's maybe not something we think about when we think about "poor people", that they have a future they're uncertain about.
