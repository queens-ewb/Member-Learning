from the ewb library

talk to Mel -- she ran this in schools with YV


 * intro blurb -- is this really like what our overseas peeps do? Will we cause confusion/misinformation about what we do?

 * Can we frame it a little closer to home? (more useful, pertinent)

 * can we have a Poverty Monster?

 * oh man we should at least define "poverty" "'we' believe poverty is people not having what we want."


 * start by defining poverty

 * come up with value statements. stereotypical statements from places in the world
  * some people are "poor" and cannot afford smartphones, the shoes, clothes they want, ...
  * some other people (say, "the african"), can afford to buy shoes for their families and feel rich
...


 * a lot of charity-ish things use western-based metrics of stuff...

 * talk about harry truman? (devs was proposed as an economic measure)

Definitions are awesome!!

Also, talking about language is fun.

Place context in time and space. (ie queens, today, smartphone thing. soviet union, 60s, whatever. ...)

IDEA: mirror the outline, but swap out our own content. bring in a lot of space/time stuff 'cause it rocks.


scenario -- wolfe island ferry costs $300 each way. cause/effect system thing.
 --> disaster

scenario -- poverty "somewhere in africa". cause/effect system thing
  * colonized?
  * no infrastructure added
  * (use a real example -- haiti?)
 --> longer-term effects that lead to poverty


----------------------------------

## Intro (5 mins)

ML -- this weekly session. The goal is to take on topics that challenge everyone, in a format condusive to p2p learning -> I am definitely not an aid expert, but the combined knowledge and experience in this room is actually very interesting.

EWB -- focusses on alleviating poverty in the worst cases. seeks to address root causes. so we need to back up. waaaaaay back....

Be aware: these are all very complex terms and we can't touch on all the viewpoints.


What is Poverty? (10 mins)

Prompts

 * does it change across space and time?
 * can you characterize it not as a lack of something?
 * is the standard of what is/is not poverty universal?
   -> can we, the "lucky westerners", really decide where poverty is?
   -> can we ever be sure we're doing good development?
   -> can development even be "good"?


Poverty close to home:

SCENARIO:

 * finances collapse in Canada
 * banks are poor. no one has access to credit.
 * kingston is poor. services are shut down, ferry costs $200
 * your parents are poor -- can't bail you out.

 --> When do you start feeling poor?


SMALL GROUPS

bring in the Ghana example.

systems-map.
 -> categorize things as cause and effect, and link chains to start mapping out a system (EXAMPLE)
 -> (it's messy)


post the flip-chart maps at the front

critique our maps (as one big group)
 -> talk about where our maps are weak and why it's hard to find root causes.




> ## 4. Development (10 mins)

> How did development start?
>  -> truman

> What motivated it?
>  -> economics n stuff

> What have the effects been?
>  -> bad, basically
>     --> countries who had the best stuff got the most fucked up


## 5. EWB

so... how does EWB try to do good work?
