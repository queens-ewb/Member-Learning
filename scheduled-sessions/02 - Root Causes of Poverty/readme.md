talk to Mel -- she ran this in schools with YV


 * intro blurb -- is this really like what our overseas peeps do? Will we cause confusion/misinformation about what we do?

 * Can we frame it a little closer to home? (more useful, pertinent)

 * can we have a Poverty Monster?

 * oh man we should at least define "poverty" "'we' believe poverty is people not having what we want."


 * start by defining poverty

 * come up with value statements. stereotypical statements from places in the world
  * some people are "poor" and cannot afford smartphones, the shoes, clothes they want, ...
  * some other people (say, "the african"), can afford to buy shoes for their families and feel rich
...


 * a lot of charity-ish things use western-based metrics of stuff...

 * talk about harry truman? (devs was proposed as an economic measure)

Definitions are awesome!!

Also, talking about language is fun.

Place context in time and space. (ie queens, today, smartphone thing. soviet union, 60s, whatever. ...)

IDEA: mirror the outline, but swap out our own content. bring in a lot of space/time stuff 'cause it rocks.


scenario -- wolfe island ferry costs $300 each way. cause/effect system thing.
 --> disaster

scenario -- poverty "somewhere in africa". cause/effect system thing
  * colonized?
  * no infrastructure added
  * (use a real example -- haiti?)
 --> longer-term effects that lead to poverty

## Intro (5 mins)

ML -- this weekly session. The goal is to take on topics that challenge everyone, in a format condusive to p2p learning -> I am definitely not an aid expert, but the combined knowledge and experience in this room is actually very interesting.

EWB -- focusses on alleviating poverty in the worst cases. seeks to address root causes. so we need to back up. waaaaaay back....


## 1. What is Poverty? (10 mins)

Prompts

 * does it change across space and time?
 * can you characterize it not as a lack of something?
 * is the standard of what is/is not poverty universal?
   -> can we, the "lucky westerners", really decide where poverty is?
   -> can we ever be sure we're doing good development?
   -> can development even be "good"?


## 2. Wolfe Island Disaster (15 mins)

The price of gas has suddenly gone way up, and the ferry can no longer operate for free. A one-way trip costs $150.

Who are some stakeholders?

 * A farmer who formerly relied on frequent small deliveries to the mainland
 * A doctor who commutes every day to Kingston for work

In small groups, map out causes and effects in a system map. notice the original problem manifests itself as many symptoms which might easily be mistook for causes themselves.


## 3. Haiti (15 mins)

a lot of things have happened to people in haiti.

give some more framing... without getting too hung up on details... system map of haiti, try to see if we can find root causes.


## 4. Development (10 mins)

How did development start?
 -> truman

What motivated it?
 -> economics n stuff

What have the effects been?
 -> bad, basically
    --> countries who had the best stuff got the most fucked up


## 5. EWB

so... how does EWB try to do good work?
