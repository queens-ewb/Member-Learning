# Youth Venture mini-session

## Framing blurb:

Youth Venture aims to initiate Hope Team Kingston this year. The Hope Team was a successful venture by another chapter this past year. It is essentially a junior EWB chapter consisting of high school aged students from different schools who meet and organize events to discuss topics of their choice. We are passionate about inspiring change leaders. This year we are planning to help begin the Hope Team by finding a student liaison and team of committed high school students, assisting them with the resources they need, and helping plan events with the students.
