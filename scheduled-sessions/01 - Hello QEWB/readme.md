Hello QEWB
==========

The first ML of 2013/14, to be held on Wednesday, September 11th, 2013.

Instead of doing the usual "hey, we're ewb, this is what we do, these are our portfolios, blah blah blah...", it would be way cooler if we could accomplish the same goal but in ML style. Instead of talking about what we do, just do what we do, with everybody.

The working idea at this point is: Quick portfolio spiels, then break off into groups by portfolio. Portfolios will run a relevant mini-session, ideally accompplishing something productive for their portfolio. The sessions will be very short, running twice so that people can learn about multiple portfolios.


Desired Outcomes
----------------

 * A session in which the awesomeness of QEWB is acurately represented.
 * Prospective members highly engaged.
 * Improvements to portfolios spreads ownership, investment, and responsibility broadly accross the member base.


Ideas
-----

see the [brainstorm](brainstorm.md) document.


Detailed Outline
----------------

### Part One: Hello (15 min)

 * (3 min) welcome, basic framing
 * (12 min) spiels


### Part Two: Mini-Sessions (20 min, repeated twice)

 * Session in groups by portfolio-ish. Exec facilitate, strive for maximum engagement.

   Imaginary example mini-session for say, the QEWB 1337 h4xx portfolio:

    * (3 min) Intros -- name, why you're here, your favourite linux vulnerability
    * (5 min) Read over a case study of a hacker, say Aaron Swartz.
    * (7 min) In two groups, discuss ethics of hacking in this case. Is hacking ever ethical?
    * (5 min) Full group: share ideas and discuss


### Parth Three: Wrap Up (5 min)

 * blah blah.


_is there time to do a bigger group wrap-up where we go around and talk about interesting things that came up?_
