Hello QEWB
==========

The first ML of 2013/14, to be held on Wednesday, September 11th, 2013.

Instead of doing the usual "hey, we're ewb, this is what we do, these are our portfolios, blah blah blah...", it would be way cooler if we could accomplish the same goal but in ML style. Instead of talking about what we do, just do what we do, with everybody.

The working idea at this point is: Quick portfolio schpiels, then break off into groups by portfolio. Portfolios will run a relevant mini-session, ideally accompplishing something productive for their portfolio. The sessions will be very short, running twice so that people can learn about multiple portfolios.


Desired Outcomes
----------------

 * A session in which QEWB is acurately represented.
 * Prospective members highly engaged.
