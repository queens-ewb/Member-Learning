### Agriculture As a Business Fails to Scale

Agriculture contributes to 35.8% of
Ghana’s GDP (2006) and provides the main
source of livelihood for about 60% of the
population. In rural northern Ghana, over
80% of people earn their income from
farming, but lack the education and busi-
ness skills to run their farms as
profitable businesses.
EWB has been working with the Min-
istry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA) in
Ghana since 2004. In 2007, we began work
with MoFA staff to develop a training
program for farmers called Agriculture As
a Business (AAB). Its objectives were to:
1.	 Build strong Farmer-Based Organiza-
tions (FBOs) with a united purpose,
2.	 Train farmers in business skills and
decision-making,
3.	 Build MoFA extension capacity in
FBO development and promote
agriculture as a business.

For over two years, EWB staff, alongside
MoFA’s best field staff, were develop-
ing, designing, testing and adapting a
series of training modules. Together they
drove the development of AAB, working
to understand the program’s strengths
and weaknesses in implementation. This
combined effort led to great ownership of
AAB among EWB staff and top-performing
MoFA staff, but not among district
management.
The underlying hypothesis was that
MoFA’s management would see the value
in this tool, and would subsequently
coordinate its expansion. This hypothesis
was based on previous scale successes,
previous adoption of EWB tools, and
verbal verification of interest from MoFA
leadership – but this hypothesis was not
tested until too late.
This was our failure. We were build-
ing strong relationships with MoFA as we
built the AAB tool, but we weren’t building
ownership beyond a handful of top-per-
forming staff. EWB also lagged in defining
sustainable success. In addition to this,
AAB’s independent implementation plan
(without EWB’s support) wasn’t developed
until 2009, which was too late. The staff in
these districts were accustomed to EWB
driving the AAB program and weren’t
ready to take ownership and drive the
program without EWB’s presence.
We also assumed that donors and the
Ministry would continue to prioritize
support for, and investment in, Farmer-
Based Organizations. This was incorrect.
Incentive structures in MoFA are largely
top-down and driven by NGOs or donor


projects that contribute funds to the dis-
trict. Therefore, if those at the top decide
not to invest in FBO development, it’s
very difficult for a district to maintain this
priority on their own. The AAB program
faced unfavourable odds no matter what it
achieved.
This is not to say that there aren’t
MoFA staff who are driven to do the best
work for farmers, despite the political
priorities of the day. But they can’t yet
overcome an incentive system where
money, power, and promotions carry a
heavy weight. Additionally, they must fol-
low directional orders from management.
Today, of the twenty districts that
received AAB training, roughly only three
of them are still using it in a significant
way. In most districts, MoFA staff were
confused and disappointed when EWB left
them to carry on alone without any ad-
ditional support. Only the most motivated,
hard-working and independent field staff
are still using the tool.
This is an especially frustrating failure
because the tool worked, and it worked
well. But it wasn’t enough to overcome
the deep-rooted incentive system within
MoFA.


What could we have done
differently?


There are two possible answers to this
question:
1.	 Before we began development, we
could have established a condi-
tional agreement with top leaders to
expand the program if results war-
ranted, all while operating within
MoFA’s existing incentive structures.
2.	 We could have separated the audi-
ence for the testing and develop-

ment phase from the sustainability
and ownership phase. We could have
developed AAB with one group of
MoFA staff, but when it came time
to test if MoFA could implement
the tool unaided, we could have
worked with a different group. This
may have created less confusion
about EWB’s role in the initiative
and potentially increased ownership
and sustainability of the tool in new
districts.


Going forward


We’ve realized that trends change,
just as politics and donors do. We
need to track these evolutions more
closely and evolve our strategies
simultaneously.
•	 AAB is a great tool that works well,
but a district-by-district approach to
implementation is virtually impos-
sible given the current incentives in
the government system.
•	 We must strive to understand who
makes decisions and how a tool
could be institutionalized within
MoFA in the future.
•	 We have had a lot of interest from
the private sector and NGOs to use
the tool in other contexts. We will
generate extra revenue by develop-
ing a training package and scaling it
through other partners.
•	 In developing new tools, we will
ensure buy-in from senior manage-
ment, as well as a plan for scaling
that we can test before investing
many resources in prototyping and
piloting. F





### Walking the Walk on Transparency


For almost two years, the promotion of
transparency has been a staple of EWB’s
work in donor policy influence. EWBers
called on our government to sign the
International Aid Transparency Initiative
(IATI). We wrote opinion pieces, engaged
thousands to sign petitions, and sat down
with over 40% of Canada’s MPs – every-
thing we could to draw attention to the
need for improved Canadian aid
transparency.
Soon, attention turned inward, and we
realized we were falling short in our own
transparency. To both influence other ac-
tors in the development sphere to become
compliant, and to “walk the walk” in our
advocacy efforts with the Government,
the need for the improvement of our own
transparency became clear. We commit-
ted – with minimal understanding of the
endeavour – to publish data in compliance
with the IATI standard.
Working closely with global aid
transparency experts (organizations like
aidinfo, Publish What You Fund and the Open
Aid Registry), we formally published data
in the IATI registry about our work in
Malawi’s water and sanitation sector just


before the Busan High Level Forum on Aid
Effectiveness. We were proud of this feat,
as well as the opportunity to role model
NGO transparency at an international
level.
Despite this public victory, it became
apparent that EWB had more work to
do to institutionalize transparency, and
IATI-compliance, as a core tenant of our
operating style. Knowing our existing
information management systems were
inconsistent and often ad-hoc, a lot had to
be done to ensure we’d be able to publish
data regularly - a defining element of
“open data”.
Our failure thus far is clear: we haven’t
created a sustainable process to manage
information and regularly publish to the
IATI registry. We failed to establish a long-
term process; instead continued to rely on
the spontaneous efforts of our volunteers
and staff. While IATI is meant to improve
aid effectiveness by making more and
better information available, this is only


possible when quality information is
published consistently – which we have
not set ourselves up to do.
Our operational culture draws heav-
ily on the resilience of our people, rather
than that of our internal processes. While
our commitment to transparency is
genuine, our efforts have been sporadic,
short-sighted, and poorly managed.


EWB truly values openness and deeply
understands the merits of transparency –
yet, despite the publication of this failure
report and a committed culture of learn-
ing, we’ve failed to build strong informa-
tion management systems.
We have failed to invest enough re-
sources to integrate these systems at EWB.
As our work grows in scale and complex-
ity, it will become more urgent to mature
and place greater emphasis on building
knowledge management systems.
Moving forward, it’s paramount that
we build a process to consistently publish
to the IATI standard. As Water for People
CEO Ned Breslin notes, “let’s not stop
there – let’s actually push to answer the
effectiveness question as well, and insist
that we not only track where the money
goes, but also whether it truly trans-
formed lives – and do all this transpar-
ently.” F
