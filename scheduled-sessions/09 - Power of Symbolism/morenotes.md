## Intro


### Conrasting Relatable Symbols

contrast this symbol (no entry): http://www.bigdug.co.uk/images/traffic-no-entry-safety-sign-p3100-208781_zoom.jpg
with this symbol (marriage equality): http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/2013/03/484771_10200138166671792_451927531_n_0.jpg

They are actually quite visually similar, both can elicit a pretty gutteral response, but have very different symbolism.
