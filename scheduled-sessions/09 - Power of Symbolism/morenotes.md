## context from previous stuff this year

 * We did look at imagery in some previous MLs:
    * Toms Shoes/ Oliberte
    * Global Markets (a bit, in videos)
 * We will be conrtrasting symbolism from Private and Intergovernental (and Gov't for coins)
    * Chapter Retreat introduced a four-way categorization of .... things:
        1) Government
        2) Inter-Governmental
        3) Non-Governmental
        4) Private/ Corporate



## Session Thesis

* Symbolism is is powerful and dates waaaaay back (Augustus)
* Private NGOs use the language of development to create legitimacy
* NGO marketing enables action, but can convey victimization, perpetuate stereotypes, ...
* When most of our images of "people from india" or "people from africa" are selected as the most appropriate for marketing, it warps our idea of those people
* Symbolism is very easy to overlook
* Question who is making the imagery

## Intro


### Conrasting Relatable Symbols

contrast this symbol (no entry): http://www.bigdug.co.uk/images/traffic-no-entry-safety-sign-p3100-208781_zoom.jpg
with this symbol (marriage equality): http://www.msnbc.com/sites/msnbc/files/2013/03/484771_10200138166671792_451927531_n_0.jpg

They are actually quite visually similar, both can elicit a pretty gutteral response, but have very different symbolism.
