Retreat!

## Barriers to Active Participation

Context:

 * This retreat
 * Exec meetings
 * Meetings with directors, GMs, ..
 * ML
 * Sessions at other events (tri-chapter, QGIC, ...)
 * Most sessions that aren't lectures!


Desired Outcome (bear with me):

 * A solid plan for encouraging, enabling, active participation!
 * Ideally be easy to apply to an existing session

  -> Paradox? Since we really should have everyone actively participating in the process of determining how best to enable that...
     => Iterate! Lets come up with some ideas, then run this session again but applying those ideas to come up with better ideas, and the run it again applying those better ideas in ordert to come up with the BEST Ideaaaaasssss...
     => Boostrap: I'm going to do my best to apply my own ideas and blah


### Assumptions:

 * ...


### Format:

 * All this framing crap is getting borrrrrrrinnnnnnng....


### Probably bad definitions:

**Active**: engages, vocalizes, contributes, ..  
**Passive**: listens, ..



What does it look like?

  * Is it different for different people? intro/extroverts? exec/GMs? ...
  * What makes it intimidating?
     -> are there risks for the participant? Social, etc.
  * How does context affect things? ie if you know everyone in the group, size of group, ...


Active vs (the evil) reactive.
