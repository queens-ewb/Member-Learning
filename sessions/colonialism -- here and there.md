idea from Mikhaela

> I am doing some readings for one of my classes right now (intro to Aboriginal Studies - DEVS220) and I had an idea that I wanted to share with you, since I know you're really interested/invested in Indigenous issues. 
>
> I'm reading the Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples -- it's a document meant to explore the past and present relationship between Aboriginal Peoples and Canadian gov't & society, and also to make recommendations for how a completely new relationship can be established and what it should look like.

> This line (from the 'getting started' section) stuck out at me:
>
> while we assume the role of defender of human rights in the international community, we retain, in our conception of Canada's origins and make-up, the remnants of colonial attitudes of cultural superiority that do violence to the Aboriginal peoples to whom they are directed. Restoring Aboriginal nations to a place of honour in our shared history, and recognizing their continuing presence as collectives participating in Canadian life, are therefore fundamental to the changes we propose. 
> so this is not a new concept at allâ€¦ but I took a moment to think about how true it is. the relationship we have with First Nations is incredibly similar to the relationships established when colonizers entered many different African countries. I think it would be really cool to explore this in ML to better understand both, what colonization looked like (similarities and differences), and how atrocious the current relationship with first nations is & what we can learn from the decolonization of other nations (what can be done similarly, what must be done differently, what must be done better).


## The Panel

* Nick???

Comment from Mikhaela: I don't think that participating in this format is going to be as easy for members as you think, Phil! Haha I have no idea what I'm doing but I'm hoping this will work. Maybe a session on how to contribute would be helpful? Or gamifying it the way you were thinking. I'd say there should be a really good incentive though in order to reduce the barrier of intimidation (especially for non-engineers!) So far I'm having fun though :). 

On the topic of this session: Here's a heart-wrenching documentary I watched on Residential Schools in Canada: http://aptn.ca/pages/wewerechildren/. It's horrifying but very worthwhile... Under what portfolio would this session follow? Elise's 'international development' portfolio? I'm excited to hear more about that one.
