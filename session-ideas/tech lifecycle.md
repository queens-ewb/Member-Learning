Another Mikhaela pitch

> I think it would be really interesting to have an interdisciplinary panel group to discuss this issue. The panelists, for example, might be: 
>
> 1. Dr. Allison Goebel (she teaches Environmental Justice, ENSC321 -- the class in which I saw the documentary), 
> 2. Dr. Champagne (she used to teach a course about waste management and talked about waste exportation in one of her introductory lectures OR Ryley (since she teaches the landfills course about waste management) OR Dr. Filion since he teaches a course on applied sustainability and talks about lifecycle design (and has worked with EWB before and liked us)â€¦ these are all civil profs. EWB and the civil department have had pretty good connections over the years :)
> 3. a prof who's interested in sustainability maybe from the computing (hardware) department who can offer a little more insight on the technical aspects of electronics, and 
> 4. a commerce or business prof (perhaps stephen moore but maybe someone else) who can talk about the business side of this
>
> lol i'm also going to send this idea to phil! it could be a neat ML! Watching the video, followed by discussion :P
>
> HOW BAD-ASS WOULD THIS BE as a special-addition extended ML?! (maybe 30 minutes to watch the documentary, 30 minutes for panel questions, another 30 minutes for audience questions, another 30 minutes for refreshments and mingling/general dialogue). YO. word.
