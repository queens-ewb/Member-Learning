I want to do at least one, maybe more sessions on gender. I don' think a whole session on gender in Canada, or even just at Queen's, would be about of place. And there is a ton of potential for collaboration with other campus groups on this one.

I feel that this is one that can help bridge Canadians to issues in Africa. The gender issues faced at Queen's vs in Canada generally vs Internationally generally vs in Africa vs in the African countries EWB works in are probably different in a lot of ways, but hopefully the same in enough ways that it can help people connect.
