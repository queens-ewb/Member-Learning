# Sessions

This folder has a ton of files containing ideas for member learning sessions next year.

In total, we'll be able to run 20ish sessions, give or take. As they become confirmed, this directory may become more structured to accommodate results and feedback in addition to just ideas.

I want to keep this as open and transparent as possible, so I plan on putting everything up here. If there are some sessions which will rely on shock or surprise to be effective, we can accommodate those as needed (less publicly, although who really is ever going to find this anyway?).


## Pitch a Session

PLEASE PITCH IDEAS! I LOVE IDEAS!

You have options:

1. [for techies or the ambitious] fork this repo, add your session, and submit a pull request. And then we can talk!
2. Find me (come to an ML!) and bring it up! Send me an email! (uniphil@gmail.com). Or get in touch in any way.
