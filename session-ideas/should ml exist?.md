# Should Member Learning Exist at Queen's University?

Lets go all in -- decide in the session, as a membership, whether or not ml should exist, and follow through with that decision.

... a simple answer of "no" could happen. But hopefully it would be more like "well, if we change x and y, acknowledge that we can't actually do z, and try really hard for a, then maybe ml is ok".

If this happens, I think it would be cool either a) as the first session of the year (kind of a high-stakes intro?), or maybe the first one back second term.
